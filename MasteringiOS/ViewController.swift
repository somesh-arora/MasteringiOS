For example, in the Core Data framework, Apple states that some methods of NSManagedObject should not be overridden.

            "The reuseIdentifier indicates that cells for a UITableView (or UICollectionView) can be reused. UITableView maintains an internal cache of UITableViewCell with the appropriate identifier and allows them to be reused when dequeueForCellWithReuseIdentifier is called. As a result, this increases performance of UITableView since a new view does not have to be created for a cell.",

If the data is static for the most part, it can be loaded in viewDidLoad and cached. But if the data is dynamic and likely to change often, it is preferrable to use viewDidAppear. In both instances, data should be loaded asynchronously on a background thread to avoid blocking the UI."
